# Create Slideshow from Spreadsheet

This is a Google Apps Script function that creates a Google Slides presentation based on data from a Google Sheet. I was tasked by my school to come up with a solution to the request to create a slideshow of over 100 student names for an event. This script takes a list of names, or any information you want, in a Google Spreadsheet and generates a Google Slides presentation from it. This way I didn't have to type over 100 names into each slide.

To try this yourself, create a Google Sheet, navigate to "Extensions" in the menu and click "Apps Script." Copy and paste this script and then click "Run." In your Google Drive you should see a new Google Slides presentation named 'My Google Slides Presentation' or whatever string you passed to SlidesApp.create()

I was very excited to discover Google Apps Script.
